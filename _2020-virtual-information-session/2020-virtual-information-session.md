### **Reference materials**
Here’s the list of the frequently asked questions (FAQs) from past information sessions. Download a copy of the FAQs [here](/images/e-info-session-FAQs.pdf).

**Eligibility, Criteria & Application**

* **Why should I apply for the PSC Scholarship before my final examinations? What if I change my mind?**\
  By starting on your application form early, you will have more time to prepare and submit your essay and supporting documents. The sooner you submit your application, the sooner you can focus whole-heartedly on your final examinations and concurrently be shortlisted for further assessment, if you are found suitable. This will also give you an opportunity to seek clarity on your scholarship application at an early stage. 


* **Can foreign students apply for the PSC scholarships?**\
  Singaporeans and Singapore Permanent Residents (SPRs) are eligible to apply. Candidates must obtain Singapore citizenship before their scholarships can be confirmed.


* **What are the shortlisting criteria and selection process like?**\
  We consider academic results, co-curricular activity (CCA) records, psychometric test results, school reports and National Service (NS) reports (if applicable). All shortlisted candidates for PSC Scholarships go through an interview with a psychologist and a panel interview with the PSC.


* **Will PSC consider my preliminary examination results?**\
  No, preliminary examination results are not considered as the standards vary across schools.


* **What if I did not do well for my A-Level/IB/NUS High School/Polytechnic Diploma examination?**\
  PSC considers many factors in offering a scholarship. These include your integrity, commitment to serve the community and leadership skills. Academic results are only one measure of your ability. You will still stand a chance to receive a scholarship offer, if you have strong compensating factors in other areas.


* **How will the Game-Based Assessment (GBA) be used in the selection process?**\
  In the 2021 PSC Scholarships Selection exercise, the GBA will be included in the existing range of assessment tools that the PSC uses to identify potential scholarship recipients holistically. These tools include co-curricular activity (CCA) records, psychometric tests, school assessment reports, National Service reports (if applicable), community service projects, leadership roles, other achievements, internship records and a panel interview.


* **Are there any changes to the process due to COVID-19?**\
  The PSC Secretariat is monitoring the situation closely and will practise safe distancing and preventive measures in line with advisories from the multi-ministry taskforce. We are also prepared to move assessments online, as we have done so for the past scholarship cycle in adherence to circuit breaker measures. 


* **Should I apply for the scholarship now or only after I have completed my National Service?**\
  You can submit your application any time before the closing date. If you are required to attend a PSC panel interview during National Service, it will be facilitated.


* **May I apply for a SAF or SPF Scholarship even though I have not enlisted for National Service?**\
  Yes, if you apply for a SAF or SPF Scholarship before being enlisted for National Service, PSC can still make a provisional scholarship offer, based on the information in your application package. You will need to qualify for Officer Cadet School (OCS) to be considered for the SAF/SPF Scholarship. PSC will look into confirming your provisional scholarship offer later on, when your military reports are available.


**Countries, Universities & Courses**

* **What courses can I pursue under a PSC scholarship?**\
  PSC scholarships holders may pursue a wide range of courses. These include engineering, science and mathematics, accountancy, law, economics, philosophy, history, etc.


* **Do I need to have a confirmed university offer before applying for a PSC scholarship? Does PSC have a list of recognised universities?**\
  You do not need to have a confirmed university offer at the time of application for PSC scholarships. PSC scholarships are awarded based on merit. All applicants, with or without a university offer, will be awarded a scholarship if they are found suitable.


* **What are the courses of study that I can take under the PSC Undergraduate Scholarship (Mid-Term)/PSC Master’s Scholarship?**\
  The course of study should be in an area relevant to the work of the Civil Service. Some courses of study are very narrow in focus and of very limited relevance to the Public Service. In such cases, we might not support that course of study. The PSC Master's Scholarship is not tenable for MBA programmes.


* **What is the duration of study under the PSC Master’s Scholarship?**\
  The PSC Master’s Scholarship is open to undergraduates or recent graduates with no more than 3 years of working experience in the private/ non-government sector. PSC Master's Scholarship holders are given up to 2 years to pursue full-time Master's programmes either locally or overseas.
